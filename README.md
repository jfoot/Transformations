# Transformations
Transformations is a free teaching and testing tool for transformations in mathematics; this includes translations, reflections, enlargements, and rotations.  The program was originally developed for a local school as part of my A-level computer science project. I have now decided to make the project publicly available for free to any other school which could benefit from it.

* The ability to create your own student and teacher accounts
* The ability to sort students into classes and record their progress.
* 8 different exams of varying difficulties on the topics of transformations
* Much more!
